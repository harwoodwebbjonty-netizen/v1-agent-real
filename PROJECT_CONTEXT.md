# Project Overview

CoPilotIQ — a sales-team CRM for cold-calling/prospecting UK companies. Two independent parts in one repo: a chat-based WAT (Workflows/Agents/Tools) framework for manual lookups, and a full desktop CRM app (Tauri + FastAPI backend) that a small sales team uses daily.

# Current Architecture

- `app/` — Tauri desktop app (Rust shell + vanilla TypeScript/Vite frontend). No API keys, no direct Anthropic calls — only talks to the backend over HTTP. Builds macOS/Windows installers via `.github/workflows/release.yml`; ships an auto-updater.
- `backend/` — FastAPI service on the VPS (213.165.88.45), served on port 80 via proxy (8000 is firewalled). Owns all Anthropic API calls, SQLite DB (WAL mode), Companies House integration. Deployed manually via rsync (see CLAUDE.md), not by app releases.
- `workflows/*.md` — five of these are read verbatim as **live backend system prompts** (see CLAUDE.md's "Production AI Prompts" table); two others are chat-only SOPs.
- The chat-based WAT layer (`tools/`, `workflows/` SOPs not listed above, `data/phone_lookups.csv`) is separate from the app/backend and used directly in Claude Code sessions.

# Important Components

- `app/src/style.css` — the authoritative design system (tokens + all styling). `CLAUDE.md`'s Design section summarises it; style.css wins on any disagreement.
- `app/src/views/*.ts` — one file per CRM page (actionCentre=Today, dashboard=Leads, coldCallLists, analytics, winBackCampaign, calendar, activityFeed, aiProspecting, settings, outreach + its sub-views).
- `app/src/components/topBar.ts` — global top-bar wiring (search, bell, user, nav counts).
- `app/src/connection.ts` — the `/health` poll driving both the offline banner and the sidebar footer status dot.
- `backend/app/db.py` — schema + migrations (`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` + `MIGRATIONS`, append-only, never edit shipped ones).
- `audits/` — point-in-time OS-audit reports checking whether this repo's own docs/memory match reality. Not code; read-only reports.

# Data / Database

SQLite at `/opt/v1-agent/backend/data/team.db` on the VPS, WAL mode. Migrations run automatically on backend restart. Companies House filing feed self-prunes to 30 days. Shared lead pool by default — leads outside a list are visible/editable to all users (deliberate).

# Integrations

- Anthropic API (backend only, `backend/.env`)
- Companies House: **two** separate keys — `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY` (REST, prospecting) and `COMPANIES_HOUSE_STREAM_KEY` (Streaming, live filing feed)
- Mailchimp export (Today page, pending email drafts)
- LinkedIn (chat-tool only, `tools/post_to_linkedin.py` + `linkedin_oauth_setup.py`, credentials via root `.env`)

# Important Project Rules

- `CLAUDE.md` is the single source of truth; `AGENTS.md` is only a pointer to it.
- Any `app/` change needs a version bump in **four** files (`app/package.json`, `app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `app/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, the `app` block in `Cargo.lock`) + tag + push — CI fails the build if the tag doesn't match. See CLAUDE.md "Releasing the app."
- Backend deploys are separate (manual rsync) and Claude is blocked from running that command in auto mode — always hand it to the user.
- Editing any of the five production `workflows/*.md` prompts changes real users' live AI calls — see CLAUDE.md's "Production AI Prompts" table before touching any of them.
- `outputs/` and `output/` (two distinct dirs, both hold real client/customer data) must never be committed — both are gitignored as of 2026-08-10.

# Current State

App is at **v0.6.4**. A multi-release frontend redesign (v0.5.0 → v0.6.4, ~10 releases) moved the whole CRM to an "editorial operations workspace" look matching an approved design artifact — presentation-only, no feature/backend changes. See `CLAUDE.md`'s Design section for the current visual system (grouped nav, footer identity block, system-sans typography, numbered sections, timeline-rail worklist, editorial tables/panels).

# Current Work

Diagnosing a user-reported regression: after updating to ~v0.6.3/v0.6.4, the app shows **no leads and no worklist** (both empty). Not yet root-caused. Suspect a startup JS error from the recent sidebar changes (identity-switcher moved to the footer, brand `<img>` replaced with inline SVG) or the worklist-collapse refactor in `actionCentre.ts` — needs verification against the actual running app, not just `tsc`/build (both pass clean, so this is a runtime-only failure).

# Known Issues

- **Empty leads/worklist regression** (see Current Work) — unresolved.
- No Apple notarization (Gatekeeper "damaged app" on new Macs) — needs Apple Developer Program.
- No HTTPS (backend is plain HTTP to an IP) — needs a domain first.
- No automated DB backups on the VPS.
- Win-back emails have no unsubscribe link (blocked on domain/HTTPS).

# Decisions

- Redesign is presentation-only by explicit instruction: keep every existing feature/button/action; only the visual layer changes.
- `output/` and `outputs/` both stay as separate, gitignored, uncommitted local dirs (not merged/renamed) — their real client data must never enter git history.
- `AGENTS.md` stays a thin pointer, not a duplicate manual — re-collapsed 2026-08-10 after silently reverting once already (see `audits/os-audit-2026-08-10.md`).

# Next Steps

1. Diagnose and fix the empty-leads/worklist regression.
2. Keep this file updated after each meaningful change (see CLAUDE.md's Context Management Rules) — it was created 2026-08-10 and has no history before that.
